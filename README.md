# ochangelog

Automize your changelog manipulation when releasing in one of the following two ways:\n\
- get a suggestion for what the next version number should be; make use of that, for example, in a script\n\
- bump your changelog by using a `dune alias` with a `diff` action attached and calling `dune promote`

## Installation
